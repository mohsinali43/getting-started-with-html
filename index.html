    <b>What is Programming?</b><br>
<br>
In the beginning programming seems pretty difficult but as they say practice makes you 
perfect. It is similar to learning a new language; <b><em>speak</em></b>, <b><em>write</em></b> and <b><em>understand

</em></b>, more the 
practice the more fluent you get.

<b><p>Online Learning</p></b>
I find online learning very interesting, I remember when I was in <a href="www.uco.edu">UCO</a> I 
used to record in class lectures and go through the recordings while doing assignments.
With <a href="www.udacity.com">UDACITY</a> online learning is fun.<p></p>
<b>Disadvantage of Online learning for me</b><p></p>Some times I tend to skip to next lectures thinking I can learn programming 
quickly.
